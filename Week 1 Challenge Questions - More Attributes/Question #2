<!-- How can you use the lang attribute if you have a webpage that uses more than one language? For example, let's say it has one <section> element where the contents are in French, and another <section> element where the contents are in Japanese.  What can you do in this case?

Each <section> element can have it's own lang attribute if the language is changing throughout the webpage by <section>.  -->
